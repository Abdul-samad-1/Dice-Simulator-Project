# Dice-Simulator-Project
Here, i share my Dice Simulator project that is made by using the Python languages.

A dice is a small throwable object with multiple resting positions, used for generating random number. This makes dice suitable as gambling devices for games like craps, or for use in non-gambling tabletop games.
A traditional die is an often rounded cube, with each of its six faces showing a different number. The design as a whole is aimed at the die providing a randomly determined integer from one to six, each of those values being equally likely. A variety of similar devices are also described as dice; such specialized dice may have polyhedral or irregular shapes and may have faces marked with symbols instead of numbers. They may be used to produce results other than one through six. Loaded and crooked dice are designed to favor some results over others for purposes of cheating or amusement.
